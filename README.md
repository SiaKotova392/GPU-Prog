# GPU Programming for Video Games
This repository contains the unitypackages that are created as a part of the GPU Programming for Video Games course that covers state-of-the-art GPU and multicore architectures from application and hardware design perspectives, as well as programming models using examples from the algorithmic needs of modern 3-D games (e.g., geometry processing, shading algorithms, physical modeling, and collision detection).
